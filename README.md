# OxYdE

Lightweight library for testing and documenting RESTful APIs.

## Why
There are few approaches to test and document RESTful APIs.
Some of them are excellent in testing and some of them in documenting RESTful APIs.
I was looking for a tool that combines both of these capabilities.
I need a tool that automates tests, and keeps APIs in sync with documentation.

This tool is named **OxYdE**.

Use **OxYdE** to: 
- write tests extremely fast,
- structure tests as needed,
- test all RESTful methods,
- automate testing process,
- generate and publish API documentation, 
- keep API in sync with documentation.
